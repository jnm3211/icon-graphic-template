			<p class="intro">The Jamaica Neighborhood Plan is an initiative to rezone a large portion of downtown Jamaica, Queens over the next 15 years to create thousands of new residential homes and commercial developments. The proposal is currently up for approval by the New York City Council, but residents and community stakeholders say they’re concerned the proposal does not take input from current Jamaican residents who would be impacted by the new developments.
			</p>
			<!-- Regular body paragraph -->
			<p>
				Residents say the proposal could displace residents and local businesses. The high rises could overshadow small residental houses that also occupy the area. A portion of the neighborhood is in a flood plain and residents and community leaders are concerned the plan does not include provisions to address flooding concerns.

Concerns exist that increased development, even with affordable housing components, could drive up rents and property taxes, leading to indirect displacement and exacerbating gentrification

While the plan's supporters emphasize the need for new housing and investment, community opponents, including Community Board members, have expressed worries about the impact on current residents, infrastructure, and neighborhood character. </figcaption>

Residents and community leaders are concerned the plan does not include provisions to address flooding. Councilmember Nantasha Williams said she’s working on securing  “guarantees,” to make it into the final draft proposal, including infrastructure improvements for sewage capacity, flood mitigation, as well as the oversight taskforce made up of community members.</figcaption>
